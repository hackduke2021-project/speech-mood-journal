This is a project for HackDuke2021 Code for Good by Emily Sun, Grace Liu, Jaeden Toy, and RP Pornmongkolsuk.

## Inspiration
Bullet journaling is a very common hobby for people nowadays, filled with colorful drawings and long daily entries. A very common feature is daily mood drawings, with little shapes filled in with colors to correspond with certain emotions. Some people (such as very busy college students) may not have the time to sit down and draw out each graphic, or they may be busy with their hands working on other projects. Whenever the stresses of life catch up, we have all found it very helpful to rant sometimes, whether it be to friends, families, or simply to an empty room. We consulted a medical professional, who stated that voicing your thoughts out loud provides different levels of benefit in comparison to silently writing them. It gives a sense of emotional objectivity, as we are able to verbalize our internal thoughts. We decided to combine these two aspects into a single application, where users can talk out their feelings and log their moods over time. 

## What it does
Using our project, the user records an audio of them talking about their day. It will then transcribe the audio and assign the text to the current day. It will also give a score to the user of the overall mood of their text, ranging from negative to positive. The user can click a certain day in order to see the text that they transcribed as well as the mood on that day. 

## Challenges We Ran Into
None of us have had previous front-end experience, so we had to learn how to program in HTML and CSS during the hackathon. Additionally, none of us have had extensive back-end experience, so we had to learn how to implement APIs during the hackathon.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
As this is one of the first hackathons for all of us, we had no idea what we were getting into. We are proud of the fact that we have an aesthetically pleasing visual for our project. Also, we are proud of the fact that we now know how to call a basic API.

## What we learned
We learned how to call an API, as well as how to make a visually pleasing website for the front end. We also learned how to use HTML and CSS and Python, as well as Django to attempt to connect the frontend to the backend.

## What's next
Our next step would be to connect the back end to the front end using some sort of Python web framework such as Django. We also hope to use the sentiment analysis and correspond it with shades of white to create a sort of color gradient to implement into our calendar rather than just sticking with the three different colors. Additionally, we would like to have ways to record directly into the website rather than having to upload pre-recorded files.
