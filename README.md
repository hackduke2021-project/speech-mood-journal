## Inspiration
Bullet journaling is a very common hobby for people nowadays, filled with colorful drawings and long daily entries. A very common feature is daily mood drawings, with little shapes filled in with colors to correspond with certain emotions. Some people (such as very busy college students) may not have the time to sit down and draw out each graphic, or they may be busy with their hands working on other projects. Whenever the stresses of life catch up, we have all found it very helpful to rant sometimes, whether it be to friends, families, or simply to an empty room. We consulted a medical professional, who stated that voicing your thoughts out loud provides different levels of benefit in comparison to silently writing them. It gives a sense of emotional objectivity, as we are able to verbalize our internal thoughts. We decided to combine these two aspects into a single application, where users can talk out their feelings and log their moods over time.
